## Interests and Expertise
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, MATLAB, R

Here are some areas I'm particularly interested in and skilled at:

Biomedical image processing: I apply computational techniques to analyze tissue samples images. I extract meaningful information from different modalities (i.e. histology, imaging technique such as mueller polarimetry) and cross-reference them, helping in the understanding and diagnosis of diseases across mutiple levels.<br>

Medical data visualization: I create medical data visualization tools through user-friendly GUI-based python or web-based applications, allowing healthcare professionals and other researchers to interactively explore and interpret complex medical datasets.

Quantitative image analysis: I measure and analyze various features, such as intensities, shapes, textures, and spatial relationships within the images to identify pattern in images. This allows to characterize structures such as diseases in medical images.
